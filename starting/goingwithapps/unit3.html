        <p>In this project, I explored the concept of HStack, which allows for horizontal stacking of views in SwiftUI. It enables a flexible layout where elements are aligned horizontally, making it easier to create user-friendly interfaces.</p>
        
        <p>Similarly, VStacks enable vertical stacking of elements, providing the foundation for arranging content in a columnar layout. This helps structure the UI with vertical alignment, ensuring that all components are neatly positioned.</p>

        <p>SwiftUI is a powerful framework that significantly simplifies UI development across Apple platforms. It allows for declarative syntax, making it more efficient to create complex layouts with minimal code. The framework automatically handles updates when the data changes, making development smoother.</p>

        <p>Understanding Swift is crucial, as it is the language that powers the development of apps on Apple devices. By diving deeper into Swift, I gained a solid understanding of how to write better code and efficiently manage data and actions within the UI.</p>

        <p>The use of structs is essential in Swift. Structs provide a lightweight, efficient way to encapsulate related data. They are value types, meaning that each instance holds its own unique copy of data, which is crucial for maintaining clean, independent views in SwiftUI.</p>
