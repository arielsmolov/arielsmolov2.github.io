    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <div class="overview-content">
      <p><strong>Parameters:</strong> Parameters are used to pass information into functions. They allow functions to accept different values when called, making them more flexible and reusable.</p>
      <p><strong>Commands:</strong> Commands are instructions that tell the computer to perform specific tasks. They form the basis of programming logic and are executed sequentially.</p>
      <p><strong>For Loops:</strong> For loops are used to repeat a block of code a specified number of times. They are useful for iterating over collections or performing repetitive tasks.</p>
      <p><strong>Conditional Code:</strong> Conditional code uses statements like if, else if, and else to perform different actions based on different conditions. It allows for decision-making in code.</p>
      <p><strong>Logical Operators:</strong> Logical operators (such as AND, OR, and NOT) are used to combine or negate conditions in conditional statements. They help create complex logic by combining multiple conditions.</p>
      <p><strong>Variables:</strong> Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated throughout a program. They hold values like numbers, strings, or objects.</p>
      <p><strong>Types:</strong> Types define the kind of data that can be stored in variables, such as integers, floats, strings, or booleans. Different types dictate what operations can be performed on the data.</p>
      <p><strong>Initialization:</strong> Initialization is the process of assigning an initial value to a variable. It is important for ensuring that variables have a known value before they are used in calculations or operations.</p>
